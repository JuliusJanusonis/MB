Defects related to sample properties can be intrinsic or extrinsic 


Extrinsic defects
are inherent to optical element production processes: glass shaping, polishing,
cleaning and deposition procedures [28, 29, 41, 42, 140, 141]. These are impurit-
ies !!(usually isolated nm size particles)!!
 that result in band tail states!!!
 and surface
states (film interfaces and grain boundaries)!!!,
 scratches, pits, fractures and other
macro and microscale structures that are formed or embedded during the external treatment of the material.
